This was a mini-project that allowed me to practice utilizing a framework that I was unfamiliar with, ReactJS.\
This is a basic web application that showcases some of my mobile applications I've built. You\

To run this project, type the following lines in your terminal:\
cd ITIS4440_Individual_Project\
